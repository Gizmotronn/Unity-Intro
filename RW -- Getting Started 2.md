**What we're doing**

* How to use the project window to import and organize assets (Done)
* The difference between gameObjects & Prefabs

*GameManager*:

> Most games have an object called a GameManager which acts as the overall “brain” for the game. This is a standard adopted by many developers.  It’s been used so much that Unity created a special icon for it. 

> At the end of the day, it’s a script like any other. The icon just helps you recognize it since you’ll access it often. There are special icons  for other components as well. You’ll discover these as you dig deeper  into Unity.

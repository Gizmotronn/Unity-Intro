Section 1
Legal obligations when creating new software
Software developers are legally obliged to follow the law of copyright and not copy work from other developers

Software Licensing
While Arcadia is mainly going to be a games network software that will be free and open-source, the application of Arcadia has more uses, such as gamification in corporate environments, and this is why I'll be going with the Commercial/Proprietery license, as I have plans to make the Arcadia software for corporate entities. Since we would be selling the rights to other companies, this form of Arcadia serves as a commercial/sale purpose. 
Arcadia in the format that I am creating for this phase of the project is free and open-source, because my team believe that information wants to be free and by encouraging our users and other developers to improve the software, it means that the software can improve at a faster rate and there is no limiting access.

It has a name - totalItemsOnScreen, is an integer variable ( public int ) and has a whole number value that can be defined in the Unity inspector.

# Part 1

**Scene View** 

* Game view -> screen aspect ratio (4:3, for example, or a device size like iPhone)

> This allows you to make sure the game looks good on all aspect ratios  and resolutions you want to support, and that no important content is  cut off. You can add a custom aspect ratio using the *Plus* button at the bottom of the dropdown.

**Hierachy Window** 

* Contains the list of all the gameObjects in the game (scene)
* GameObject --> object in the game or scene 

GameObjects:

* Empty containers that you can customize by *adding components*

* These components permit the game object to project *geometry*:

  * > (from a simple cube to more complex 3d models of towers or monsters

  * Emit light

  * Act as a camera

  * Create complex behaviour *through scripts* 

* Act like folders --> 

  * Contain other game objects

    * Therefore useful for organising the project

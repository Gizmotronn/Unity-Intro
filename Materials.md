# Materials

* Materials define how an object looks in-game

* Textures, transparency, colour, reflectiveness, etc

* Shader:

  * Code that defines how the game engine renders an object on the screen
  * Unity has its own standard shader

* Materials are made up of:

  * Shaders (custom bodywork shader)
  * Templates (for example a car texture)
  * Colour tint
